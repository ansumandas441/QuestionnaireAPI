## Assignment: Project Questionnaire API with Strapi CMS

### Objective:

The objective of this project is to create APIs that facilitate the submission of new questionnaires based on selected project types. These APIs should allow users to select a project type, retrieve questions specific to that type, and submit their responses, including text and file uploads.

## Requirements:

### API Endpoints:

1. **POST** endpoint to receive the project type selection.
2. **GET** endpoint to retrieve questions for the selected project type.
3. **POST** endpoint to save the user's questionnaire responses (text and file uploads).

### Dynamic Question Loading:

Questions should dynamically load based on the selected project type. This involves implementing a mechanism to efficiently retrieve 60-80 questions from the Strapi CMS.

### Data Handling:

User responses must be saved and associated with the project type and questionnaire.

### Error Handling and Validation:

1. Implement robust error handling and input validation for all API endpoints.
2. Provide clear error messages to facilitate debugging and troubleshooting.

### Sample Questionary

### Deliverables:

1. Source code for the backend APIs, including Strapi integration.
2. Detailed API documentation outlining endpoints, expected inputs, and responses (can use Natspec).
3. `README` file with setup and testing instructions to expedite the candidate's onboarding process.
4. At last, submit your public repository with us.

### Testing Instructions:

1. Utilize tools like Postman or Curl to send requests to the defined endpoints.
2. Test each endpoint with valid and invalid inputs to ensure proper functionality.
3. Verify error messages and response formats.
